# Caveman

**Caveman** is an open-source educational platform that explores human evolution and the development of knowledge through interactive learning experiences. The project starts with simple concepts of self-awareness and discovery, gradually evolving into complex subjects like mathematics, physics, philosophy, and critical thinking.

## Vision

Caveman aims to create a platform where users can experience life as the first human, progressing from primitive survival to modern understanding. The platform will use a combination of interactive games, educational content, and real-world simulations to teach subjects like:

- Mathematics and pattern recognition
- Physics and natural laws
- Language development
- Philosophy and self-awareness

## Open-Source Approach

This project is entirely open-source, meaning that anyone can contribute to the development of code, content, and design. The goal is to build a community-driven platform that grows with the contributions of developers, educators, and learners worldwide.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including:

- Code development (game mechanics, AI, etc.)
- Educational content (videos, animations, lessons)
- Design and animation
- Documentation and translations

If you're interested in contributing, please review our contribution guidelines (coming soon).
